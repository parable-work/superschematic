/**
 * The config each behavior takes, keyed by the behavior's registered name.
 * It lists the behaviors the core declares (internal/registry/behaviors in
 * the superschematic repository), which @superschematic/engine implements.
 * An extension's authoring package adds its behaviors by module
 * augmentation, as it adds an invocation policy key to MCPToolOptions:
 *
 *     declare module "@superschematic/schema" {
 *       interface BehaviorConfigs {
 *         "acme.Rating": { readonly maxStars: number };
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * A behavior that takes no config maps to undefined. A program sees the
 * augmentation when it includes the file that declares it: through an
 * import of the authoring package, or a tsconfig.json include entry.
 *
 * The registry, not tsc, decides which behaviors a build accepts: it holds
 * each config to the behavior's declared config schema. A name no
 * augmentation in the program declares does not type-check, and a declared
 * name the binary does not register fails the load.
