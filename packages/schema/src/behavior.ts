/**
 * The config each behavior takes, keyed by the behavior's registered name.
 * The core declares no behavior, so the interface is empty. An extension's
 * authoring package adds its behaviors by module augmentation, as it adds
 * an invocation policy key to MCPToolOptions:
 *
 *     declare module "@superschematic/schema" {
 *       interface BehaviorConfigs {
 *         "acme.Rating": { readonly maxStars: number };
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * A behavior that takes no config maps to undefined. A program sees the
 * augmentation when it includes the file that declares it: through an
 * import of the authoring package, or a tsconfig.json include entry.
 *
 * The registry, not tsc, decides which behaviors a build accepts. A name
 * no augmentation in the program declares does not type-check, and a
 * declared name the binary does not register fails the load.
