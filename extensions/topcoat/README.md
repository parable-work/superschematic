# extensions/topcoat

The Topcoat extension for superschematic. For an API service whose server
is Rust, `outputs.topcoat` writes a crate that a
[Topcoat](https://github.com/tokio-rs/topcoat) app depends on. It sits
beside the API crate, at `<out>/topcoat/<service>`, and is named
`<rust_crate_prefix><service>-topcoat`. The crate:

- mounts the service's JSON API in the app's router, at `/api/{*rest}`;
- calls each operation in-process, from a page, a shard or a procedure, by
  its route's rules: the caller admitted as the route admits it (401, 403),
  the arguments checked as the router checks them (the same 400), then the
  implementation ([D43](../../docs/DECISIONS.md));
- offers a guard per operation, `can_<operation>`, which admits the caller
  alone;
- mirrors each type an operation returns, and the types it nests, as a
  Topcoat record a page can hand the browser.
- reads and renders a form per input type whose fields a form holds, by
  the input type's rules ([Forms](#forms)).
- lets browser code call each operation through a Topcoat procedure, its
  arguments and result records and a refusal a record it reads
  ([Procedures](#procedures)).

It is a Go module of its own, as `extensions/gcp` and `extensions/pulumi`
are. Neither the core nor the installed `superschematic`, which links gcp
and pulumi, links it (D44). `cmd/superschematic-topcoat` is the core with
it linked:

```bash
go build -o superschematic-topcoat ./cmd/superschematic-topcoat
```

A project's own binary links it beside its other extensions the same way,
passing it to `cli.New`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/parable-work/superschematic/cli"
	"github.com/parable-work/superschematic/extensions/topcoat"
)

func main() {
	if err := cli.New(cli.Config{Name: "superschematic-topcoat"}, topcoat.Extension{}).Execute(); err != nil {
		_, _ = fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

## The config

```ts
outputs: {
  types: { [TargetLanguage.Rust]: { enabled: true } },
  api: { enabled: true, language: "RUST" },
  topcoat: { enabled: true },   // records: false leaves the records out
}
```

The crate needs the Rust server. A service whose server is in another
language skips `outputs.topcoat` and logs why, so one config can serve a Go
build and `build --api-language RUST`.

A binary without the extension refuses `outputs.topcoat`, as it refuses
any outputs key no generator claims. A project that also builds its
configs with such a binary, `superschematic` among them, lists its Topcoat
services in `superschematic.toml` instead. Such a binary never reads that
table:

```toml
[extension.topcoat]
services = ["shop-orders"]
```

A listed service gets the crate with every default when its server is
Rust. `outputs.topcoat` in its config, when present, wins.

## The app

The acme shop's `examples/acme-shop/topcoat` is a Topcoat app over
`shop-orders`, and the docs site's
[Pages with Topcoat](../../docs/src/content/docs/guides/topcoat.mdx)
guide walks it. Its `app` mounts the crate:

```rust
Router::builder()
    .discover()
    .cookies()
    .sessions(SessionConfig::default())
    .app_context(Arc::clone(&sessions))
    .shop_orders(implementations(shop), SessionCaller(sessions))
    .build()
```

`shop_orders` takes the API's `Implementations`, the same value the JSON
API serves, and a `PageAuthenticator` when an operation needs a caller.
The authenticator establishes a page's caller, here from the app's
Topcoat session. The API's own `Authenticator` still decides whether the
caller's permissions cover an operation's, so pages and the JSON API agree.

The app must name the crate, by `use`-ing an item of it. Topcoat discovers
items through the linker, and a crate the app never names is not linked.

## Users and sessions

When the API's users are the core user model's (D50), its
`Implementations.authenticator` is the identity runtime's, and the crate
also offers `IdentityPageAuthenticator`, beside a `PageAuthenticator` of
the app's own. It reads a page's caller from the session the request
carries, the session cookie or a bearer token, as the JSON API reads it,
so a user who signs in through the mounted `/api/auth/login` is signed in
on every page:

```rust
let pages = IdentityPageAuthenticator::of(&implementations);
Router::builder()
    .discover()
    .fixture_user_routes_api(implementations, pages)
    .build()
```

A cookie on a request other than `GET`, `HEAD` or `OPTIONS` passes the
identity config's cross-origin check, as on the JSON API, and a refused
cookie is cleared on the page's response. Topcoat's own origin policy
runs first, for pages and the mounted API alike, so an origin the identity
config trusts must also be one the app's `OriginPolicy` trusts. The
crate's `identity-postgres` and `identity-sqlite` features turn on the API
crate's.

## Records

A record holds the type's JSON as the API sends it, in the types a record
can hold:

| The type's field | The record's |
| --- | --- |
| A string, a UUID, a timestamp or an enum | `String` |
| An integer scalar | `i64` |
| A number | `f64` |
| A boolean | `bool` |
| An object type | its record |
| A list, or a list of lists | `Vec` |
| A map | `Vec<(String, T)>` |
| Optional | `Option` |
| A union, or any JSON value | its JSON text |

A field marked `@uiHidden` is left out, since everything in a record
reaches the browser. A field whose name a record reserves (`clone`,
`then`, ...) gets a trailing underscore. `From<types::X>` builds the
record from the API's value.

## Forms

An operation's input type whose fields a form holds (a string, a number,
a boolean or an enum, each alone, declared by the service itself) gets a
form in `forms`:

- **`<Input>Form`** holds each field as the browser sends it
  (`Option<String>`), so it deserializes from Topcoat's `Form<T>`, and a
  refused form renders again exactly as it was sent.
- **`parse()`** reads the fields as the input type's JSON and parses it with
  the generated `parse_<type>` and its rules ([D14](../../docs/DECISIONS.md)),
  undeclared keys refused. A checkbox is true when sent. Each field's
  errors come back as `FormErrors`. `FormErrors::from_api` reads an
  operation's refusal the same way, so a form shows both.
- **`<input>_fields(form, errors)`** is a component that renders each field
  with its label, its value as sent, and its errors:
  - each field's input type: email, url, tel, number (`step="1"` for an
    integer) or checkbox, from the field's type; `<select>` for an enum;
  - the attributes its rules give it: `required`, `min`/`max`,
    `minlength`/`maxlength`, and `pattern`. A pattern is written only when
    a browser reads it as the server does: no group syntax, and nothing
    the HTML `v` flag refuses. It is never written on an email or URL
    input, which checks its own syntax.

  A browser checks those attributes before sending, and `parse` checks
  every rule again.

```rust
#[page(POST "/signup")]
async fn sign_up(cx: &Cx, Form(form): Form<SignupInputForm>) -> topcoat::Result<impl View> {
    let errors = match form.parse() {
        Ok(input) => match operations::account_sign_up(cx, AccountSignUpArgs { input }).await {
            Ok(_) => return Err(see_other("/welcome").into()),
            Err(err) => FormErrors::from_api(&err),
        },
        Err(errors) => errors,
    };
    Ok(view! {
        (StatusCode::UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)
        <form method="post">signup_input_fields(form: form, errors: errors)</form>
    })
}
```

An input type with a list, a map, an object, a union or any JSON value
gets no form, and the build log says why. `forms: false` in
`outputs.topcoat` leaves out the module.

## Procedures

Each mounted operation is a Topcoat procedure in `procedures`, on a stable
path: `/_superschematic/<service>/<namespace>/<operation>`. The app's
`.discover()` registers them; registering one again with `.route` panics.

- **Arguments.** The procedure takes the operation's arguments as a
  record, `<Op>ArgsRecord`, with a field per argument and the input as its
  type's record. `to_args()` writes each field as the JSON a request
  carries and decodes it into the `Args` struct. A UUID or timestamp that
  does not parse is the router's 400.
- **Result.** It answers `Result<OutputRecord, ProblemRecord>`.
  `ProblemRecord` holds the route's status, code and detail, and each
  refused field's path, rule and message. A refusal reaches the browser as
  data; an `Err` of a procedure would reach it as a bare 500.
- **Body.** `call_<operation>(cx, args)` is the procedure's body as a plain
  function: the arguments decoded, then the operation called in-process by
  its route's rules. Rust code calls it, since a procedure itself is not
  callable from Rust.

Browser code imports a procedure and calls it with the arguments record
inside an event handler; see Topcoat's procedures.

Records are the arguments' and results' carriers, so `records: false`
leaves out the procedures too; `procedures: false` leaves out only them.
