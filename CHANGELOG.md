# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Every package and module in this repository shares one version
(`versions.env`). A change to the IR, to the naming file's keys, to a public
Go package (`registry`, `loader`, `cli`, `ir`, `runtime/*`) or to the shape
of a generated artifact is always listed here with the bump it requires.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Core import: the schema loaders
  (TypeScript, JSON, YAML), the IR, the registry with its extension surfaces
  (kinds, decorators, documents, generators, auth providers, commands), the
  generators (SQL, Go ORM, Go API with the `session` auth provider,
  TypeScript, Go, Python and Rust types, TypeScript, Go and Rust SDKs, env
  config, JSON Schema), the `superschematic` CLI (`build`, `build-all`,
  `json-schema`, `format`), the authoring packages `@superschematic/{schema,
  db, api, schema-config}`, the schema runtimes for Go, TypeScript and
  Python, the http runtime for Go and Rust, and the `extensions/deploy` and
  `extensions/platform` reference extensions.
- Repository bootstrap: license, contribution guide, code of conduct,
  security policy, CI (`ci.yml` with `ci-pass` as the one required check),
  the extraction scrub and the DCO check.
- `examples/acme-schematic`: a downstream extension that adds a kind, a
  decorator, a document, a generator, an auth provider and a command without
  editing the core, with a smoke script and a check that adding a second
  decorator changes nothing outside the example. Runs as the `acme` CI job.
- Release pipeline: `release.yml` verifies the tag against `versions.env`,
  runs the full CI, builds the CLI for linux and darwin on x64 and arm64,
  creates the GitHub release with provenance attestations and an SBOM, and
  publishes the npm packages, the PyPI distribution and the crate through
  trusted publishing behind `RELEASE_PUBLISH_ENABLED`. `release-pr.yml` and
  `scripts/bump_version.py` set the one shared version; `go-module-tag.yml`
  cuts `ir/vX.Y.Z`, `runtime/schema/go/vX.Y.Z` and `runtime/http/go/vX.Y.Z`
  next to `vX.Y.Z`. `scorecard.yml` runs OpenSSF Scorecard.
- Docs site (Starlight) under `docs/`: quickstarts for Go, TypeScript,
  Python and Rust, the extension guide, the deploy and platform extension
  guides, the `superschematic.toml` reference and the CLI reference.

### Changed

- Generated Go API modules require `github.com/go-chi/chi/v5` v5.3.2
  (was v5.3.1), matching `runtime/http/go`. Patch.

### Fixed

- `session` auth provider: the generated session and principal stores passed
  a `*string` where the ORM's `UUIDFilter` takes the scalar UUID, so any
  upstream DB with a `Session` or `User` table failed to compile the generated
  API. The stores now parse the id with `scalars.ParseUUID`. Found by the acme
  example.
