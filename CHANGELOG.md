# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Every package and module in this repository shares one version
(`versions.env`). A change to the IR, to the naming file's keys, to a public
Go package (`registry`, `loader`, `cli`, `ir`, `runtime/*`) or to the shape
of a generated artifact is always listed here with the bump it requires.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Core import: the schema loaders
  (TypeScript, JSON, YAML), the IR, the registry with its extension surfaces
  (kinds, decorators, documents, generators, auth providers, commands), the
  generators (SQL, Go ORM, Go API with the `session` auth provider,
  TypeScript, Go, Python and Rust types, TypeScript, Go and Rust SDKs, env
  config, JSON Schema), the `superschematic` CLI (`build`, `build-all`,
  `json-schema`, `format`), the authoring packages `@superschematic/{schema,
  db, api, schema-config}`, the schema runtimes for Go, TypeScript and
  Python, the http runtime for Go and Rust, and the `extensions/deploy` and
  `extensions/platform` reference extensions.
- Repository bootstrap: license, contribution guide, code of conduct,
  security policy, CI (`ci.yml` with `ci-pass` as the one required check),
  the extraction scrub and the DCO check.
- `examples/acme-schematic`: a downstream extension that adds a kind, a
  decorator, a document, a generator, an auth provider and a command without
  editing the core, with a smoke script and a check that adding a second
  decorator changes nothing outside the example. Runs as the `acme` CI job.
- Release pipeline: `release.yml` verifies the tag against `versions.env`,
  runs the full CI, builds the CLI for linux and darwin on x64 and arm64,
  creates the GitHub release with provenance attestations and an SBOM, and
  publishes the npm packages, the PyPI distribution and the crate through
  trusted publishing behind `RELEASE_PUBLISH_ENABLED`. `release-pr.yml` and
  `scripts/bump_version.py` set the one shared version; `go-module-tag.yml`
  cuts `ir/vX.Y.Z`, `runtime/schema/go/vX.Y.Z` and `runtime/http/go/vX.Y.Z`
  next to `vX.Y.Z`. `scorecard.yml` runs OpenSSF Scorecard.
- Docs site (Starlight) under `docs/`: quickstarts for Go, TypeScript,
  Python and Rust, the extension guide, the deploy and platform extension
  guides, the `superschematic.toml` reference and the CLI reference.
- Go ORM: every generated `<Type>Update` has `ApplyTo(*types.<Type>)`, which
  writes each set and `SetNull` field onto a stored row (SetNull wins; a nil
  receiver or row is a no-op), so a handler can check the post-update row
  before calling `UpdateOne`. Minor.
- `@denyUnknownFields` (from `@superschematic/schema`) on a type makes the
  generated Rust struct `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, so a payload key the
  type does not declare fails to decode instead of being dropped. The IR
  `TypeDef` gains `denyUnknownFields`; the schema-file JSON Schema accepts
  it. Opt-in per type. Minor.
- OpenAPI: an array field with `listMin` or `listMax` carries `minItems` or
  `maxItems`. Patch.
- `superschematic build --with-deps <service-dir>` also builds every
  service the target transitively depends on (declared dependencies plus
  `authDb`), dependencies first, with `build-all`'s discovery, ordering and
  schema catalog; siblings outside the closure are not built. Minor.

### Changed

- Generated Go API modules require `github.com/go-chi/chi/v5` v5.3.2
  (was v5.3.1), matching `runtime/http/go`. Patch.
- Generated Go ORM modules require `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` v5.11.0 (was
  v5.10.0). Patch.
- Generated Python types packages declare `*.schema.json` as package data
  next to `py.typed`, so a JSON Schema document a build step writes into the
  package directory ships in the wheel and sdist. Patch.
- Go types: a required array means present, not non-empty, as it already
  did in TypeScript and Rust. `Validate` reports `required` for a nil list
  only; an explicit `[]` is valid unless the field declares `listMin` of 1 or
  more, which reports `listMin`. Decoding (`UnmarshalJSON`, `FromMap`,
  `FromMapStrict`) keeps an absent or null list nil so the required check
  can see it; encoding still writes `[]` for a nil list. A schema that relied
  on required implying non-empty adds `listMin: 1`. Minor.
- `build-all` orders a service after its `authDb`, in sequential and
  `--parallel` builds, even when the config does not also list it under
  `dependencies`. The generated API module imports the authDb's packages,
  so it is a build-order edge. Patch.

### Fixed

- `session` auth provider: the generated session and principal stores passed
  a `*string` where the ORM's `UUIDFilter` takes the scalar UUID, so any
  upstream DB with a `Session` or `User` table failed to compile the generated
  API. The stores now parse the id with `scalars.ParseUUID`. Found by the acme
  example.
- TypeScript types: a per-type validator checked a field typed with an enum
  from a dependency package for presence only, so a strict parser accepted
  any string there. It now imports that package's enum validators from its
  `validators/enums` subpath and validates the value. Patch.
- Go types: `Parse<Scalar>` for a custom-parse scalar with a JSON-shaped Go
  type (a map) called a superscalar function by its leaf name and converted
  the returned string to the map type, which does not compile. It now calls
  `Parse<Symbol>` and decodes the canonical JSON into the alias. No scalar
  in the pinned superscalar catalog takes this path yet; `Generic.StringMap`
  does once superscalar marks it custom-parse. Patch.
- Python types: generated enums accept their serialized value when a model
  is validated with `strict=True`, in direct, list and map fields. Unknown
  values and unrelated coercions still fail. Patch.
